This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Features

- **Pagination**: Pagination is supported by the API, but since filtering is not supported, both pagination and filtering are implemented on the client side to ensure a smooth user experience. The current page is managed through the URL using query parameters for better navigation and shareability.
- **Filtering**: Filtering is done on the client side because the API does not support filtering.
- **Validation**: Form validation is implemented using React Hook Form and Zod for robust and user-friendly validation.
- **Styling**: The project uses [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) for modern, responsive, and accessible UI components.
- **Jest Testing**: The project includes unit tests for all main components using

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Running Tests

This project uses Jest for unit testing.  
To run all tests, use:

```bash
npm run test
```
